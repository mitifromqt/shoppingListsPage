# Project 1: Shared shopping list
This is my first project for Web Software Development course at "fitech101.aalto.fi" 
    +Main page: containting statistics of total number of lists and items created.
    -Shopping lists: all active shopping lists. You can deactivate a list by clicking on "Deactivate list!" button.
    -Single list: return a shopping list and all its items. You can add new item by clicking on "Add item" or collect it by "Mark completed!" button.
